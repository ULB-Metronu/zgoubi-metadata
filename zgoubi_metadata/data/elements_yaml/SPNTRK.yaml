  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  The keyword ``SPNTRK`` allows switching spin tracking on (index ``KSO``=1) or off (``KSO``=0), or resuming
  (index ``KSO``=-1, following an occurence ``KSO``=0). It also permits the attribution of an initial spin to each
  one of the ``IMAX`` particles of the beam, following a distribution that depends on the option index ``KSO``. It
  must be preceded by ``PARTICUL`` for the definition of mass and gyromagnetic factor.

  * ``KSO`` = 1 (respectively 2, 3) : the ``IMAX`` particles defined with ``[MC]OBJET`` are given a longitudinal (1,0,0)
    spin component (respectively transverse horizontal (0,1,0), vertical (0,0,1)).

  * ``KSO`` = 4 : initial spin components are entered explicitly for each one of the ``IMAX`` particles of the beam.

  * ``KSO`` = 4.1 : three initial spin components SX, SY , SZ are entered explicitly just once, they are then
    assigned to each one of the ``IMAX`` particles of the beam.

  * ``KSO`` = 4.2 : under development. Read spin components from a file, file name has to be provided. (that
    file at present can be zgoubi.res : ``KSO``=4.2 looks for key “(deg) (deg)“ that appears at start of the spin
    coordinates list under the keyword ``SPNPRT``).

  * ``KSO`` = 5 : random generation of ``IMAX`` initial spin conditions as described in Fig. 44. Given a mean
    polarization axis (S) defined by its angles T0 and P0, and a cone of angle A with respect to this axis, the
    ``IMAX`` spins are sorted randomly in a Gaussian distribution

  ..math::

    p(a) = exp\left[ - \frac{(A- a)^2}{2\delta A^2}\right] / \delta A \sqrt{2\pi}

  and within a cylindrical uniform distribution around the (S) axis. Examples of simple distributions available
  by this mean are given in Fig. 45.
