  Space charge

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  The keyword ``SPACECHARG`` enables (or disables) the calculation of space charge effects.
  It must be preceded by ``PARTICUL`` for definition of mass and charge values, as they enter in
  the definition of space charge parameters. ``SPACECHARG`` is supposed to
  appear a first time at the location where space charge effects should start
  being taken into account, with the first data ``LMNT`` set to ’all’ or a
  keyword. ``SPACECHARG`` is supposed to appear a second time at the location
  where calculations should stop, with ``LMNT`` set to ’none’.
  It results in summary outputs in zgoubi.res. Occurence of PRINT amongst ``SPACECHARG`` arguments
  results in storage of computational data and other relevant informations
  in zgoubi.SPACECHARG.out, as space charge computation proceeds.
