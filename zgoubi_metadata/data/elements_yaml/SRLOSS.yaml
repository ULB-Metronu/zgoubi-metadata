  Synchrotron radiation energy loss

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description


  The keyword ``SRLOSS`` allows activating or stopping (option ``KSR`` = 1, 0 respectively) stepwise tracking
  of energy loss by stochastic emission of photons in magnetic fields, following the method described in section 3.1[20].
  It can be chosen to allow radiation in the sole dipole fields, or in all types of fields regardless of their
  multipole composition. It can also be chosen to allow for the radiation induced transverse kick (this is yet
  to be installed in the code - not done as it is generally considered a negligible effect).
  ``SRLOSS`` must be preceded by ``PARTICUL`` for defining mass and charge values as they enter in the definition
  of ``SR`` parameters.
  Statistics on ``SR`` parameters are computed and updated while tracking, the results of which can be obtained
  by means of the keyword ``SRPRNT``.
