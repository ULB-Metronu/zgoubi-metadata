  Monte-Carlo simulation of in-flight decay

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  When ``MCDESINT``[38] is met in a structure (normally, after ``OBJET`` or after ``CIBLE``), in-flight decay simulation
  starts. It must be preceded by ``PARTICUL`` for the definition of mass ``M1`` and ``COM`` lifetime :math:`\tau_1` of the
  parent particle.
  The two-body decay simulated is

  .. math::

    1 \rightarrow  2 + 3

  The decay is isotropic in the center of mass. 1 is the incoming particle, with mass M1, momentum :math:`p1 = \gamma_1 M_1 \beta_1 c`
  (relative momentum :math:`D1 = \frac{p_1}{q}\frac{1}{BORO} with BORO = reference rigidity, defined in ``[MC]OBJET``).
  2 and 3 are decay products with respective masses and momenta M2,M3 and :math:`p2 = \gamma_2 M_2 \beta_2 c`, :math:`p3 = \gamma_3 M_3 \beta_3 c`.
  The average distance s1 at which a particle will decay is related to its center of mass lifetime :math:`\tau_1` by

  .. math::

    s_1 = c \tau_1 \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 -1}

  The actual path length s up to the decay point is calculated, for each one of the particles defined by
  ``[MC]OBJET`` and prior t ray-tracing, from a random number :math:`0 < R_1 \leq 1` by using the exponential decay
  formula

  .. math::

    s = s_1 \ln(R_1)

  After decay of the parent particle 1, particle 2 will be ray-traced with assumed positive charge, while
  particle 3 is discarded. Its scattering angles in the center of mass :math:`\theta^*` and :math:`\phi` are generated from two other
  random numbers :math:`0 < R_2 \leq 1` and :math:`0 < R_3 \leq 1` by

  .. math::

    \begin{align}
      \theta^* &= acos(1-2R_2) \text{ ( $0 < \theta^* \leq \pi$)}\\
      \phi &= 2 \pi R_3 \text{ ( $0 < \phi \leq 2\pi$)}\\
    \end{align}

  :math:`\phi` is a relativistic invariant, and θ in the laboratory frame (Fig. 43) is given by

  .. math::

    \tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{\gamma_1} \frac{\sin\theta^*}{\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2^*} + \cos\theta^*}

  :math:`\beta_2^*` and momentum :math:`\p_2` are given by

  .. math::

    \begin{align}
      \gamma_2^* &= \frac{M_1^2 + M_2^2 - M_3^2}{2M_1M_2}\\
      \gamma_2 &= \gamm_1\gamma_2^* (1+\beta_1\beta_2\cos\theta^*)\\
      \beta_2 &= (1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_2^2})^{1/2}\\
      p_2 = M_2 \sqrt{\gamma_2^2 -1}
    \end{align}

  Finally, :math:`\theta` and :math:`\phi` are transformed into the angles T2 and P2 in the zgoubi frame, and the relative momentum
  takes the value :math:`D2 = \frac{p_2}{q}\frac{1}{BORO} with BORO = reference rigidity, see ``OBJET``), while the starting
  position of M2 is the very location of the parent particle decay, (Y1,Z1, s1).
  The decay simulation by zgoubi satisfies the following procedures. In optical elements and field maps,
  after each integration step ``XPAS``, the actual path length of the particle, F(6, I), is compared to its limit path
  length s. If s is passed, then the particle is considered as having decayed at :math:`F(6, I) − \frac{XPAS}{2}`, at a position
  obtained by a linear translation from the position at F(6, I). Presumably, the smaller ``XPAS``, the smaller the
  error on position and angles at the decay point. In ``ESL`` and ``CHANGREF``, F(6, I) is compared to s at the end of the element.

  If the decay occurs inside the element, the particle is considered as having decayed at its actual limit path length s, thus its coordinates at
  s are recalculated by translation.
  The limit path length of all particles (I = 1, ``IMAX``) is stored in the array ``FDES`` (6, I). For further statistical
  purposes (e.g., use of ``HISTO``) the daughter particle 2 is tagged with an ′S′ standing for “secondary”. When
  a particle decays, its coordinates D, Y , T, Z, P, s, time at the decay point are stored in ``FDES`` (J, I), J = 1, 7.

  * A note on negative drifts* :

  The use of negative drifts with ``MCDESINT`` is allowed and correct. For instance, negative drifts may occur in a structure
  for some of the particles when using ``CHANGREF`` (due to the Z-axis rotation or a negative ``XCE``),
  or when using ``DRIFT`` with XL < 0. Provision has been made to take it into account during the
  ``MCDESINT`` procedure, as follows.
  If, due to a negative drift, a secondary particle reaches back the decay location of its parent particle, then
  the parent particle is “resurrected “ with its original coordinates at that location, the secondary particle is
  discarded, and ray-tracing resumes in a regular way for the parent particle which is again allowed to decay,
  after the same path length. This procedure is made possible by prior storage of the coordinates of the parent
  particles (in array ``FDES`` (J, I)) each time a decay occurs.
  Negative steps (``XPAS``< 0) in optical elements are not compatible with ``MCDESINT``.
