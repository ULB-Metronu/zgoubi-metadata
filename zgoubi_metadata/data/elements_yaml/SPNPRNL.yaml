  Store spin coordinates in file FNAME

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``SPNPRNL`` has similar effect to ``SPNPRT`` (page 195), except that the information is stored in a dedicated file ``FNAME`` (should
  post-processing with zpop follow, advised name is ``FNAME`` = ‘zgoubi.spn’ (formatted write) or ‘b zgoubi.spn’ (binary write) ).
  The data are formatted and ordered according to the FORTRAN sequence found in the subroutine spnprn.f, with meaning of
  printed quantities as follows :

    * ``LET(I),IEX(I) : tagging character and flag (see ``OBJET``)

    * ``SI(1-4,I)`` : spin components SX, SY , SZ and modulus, at the origin

    * ``SF(1-4,I)`` : idem at the current position

    * ``GAMMA`` : Lorentz relativistic factor

    * ``I`` : particle number

    * ``IMAX`` : total number of particles ray-traced (see ``OBJET``)

    * ``IPASS`` : turn number (see ``REBELOTE``)
