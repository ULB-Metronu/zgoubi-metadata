  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``PLOTDATA`` was at the origin implemented for the purpose of plotting particle coordinates using the ``TRIUMF`` ``PLOTDATA``
  package [67]. However nothing precludes using it with a different aim.
  The ``PLOTDATA`` keyword can be introduced at up to 20 locations in zgoubi.dat. There, particle coordinates will be stored in a
  local array, ``FF``. They are overwritten at each pass. Usage of ``FF`` is left to the user, see ``FORTRAN`` subroutine pltdat.f.
