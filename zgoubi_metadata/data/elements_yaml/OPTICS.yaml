  Write out optical functions. Log to zgoubi.OPTICS.out

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``OPTICS`` normally appears next to object definition, it normally works in conjunction with element label(s).
  ``OPTICS`` causes the transport and write out, in zgoubi.res, of the 6×6 beam matrix, following options ``KOPT``
  and ’label ’, below.

  * IF ``KOPT``=0 : Off

  * IF ``KOPT``=1 : Will transport the optical functions with initial values as specified in ``OBJET``, option ``KOBJ``=5.1.
  Note that ``OPTICS`` assumes the first particle of the set of 11 as defined by ``OBJET``, to be the reference particle
  for computation of the transport coefficients.

  Note : In the case of a periodic structure, the initial coordinate values in ``OBJET``[``KOBJ``=5.1] may be
  the periodic ones (as obtained, for instance, from a first run using ``MATRIX``[``IFOC``=11]). Using ``TWISS``
  keyword instead may be considered in that case.
  A second argument, ’label ’, allows

  * if label = all : printing out, into zgoubi.res, after all keywords of the zgoubi.dat structure,

  * otherwise, printing out at all keyword featuring ``LABEL`` ≡ label as a first label (see section 7.7,
  page 200, regarding the labelling of keywords).

  ``PRINT`` : An optional third argument, ``IMP``=1, or equivalently the command ``PRINT``, will cause saving of
  the transported optical functions into file zgoubi.OPTICS.out.

  * About the source code* :

  The program beamat ensures the transport of the beam matrix along the zgoubi.dat sequence. beamat is
  called by opticc, itself called after each optical element, in the program zgoubi.
  The starting beam matrix value is in the array FI, initialized by OBJET[KOBJ=5.1], program obj5. The
  array F0 contains the running beam matrix. The program beaimp prints to zgoubi.res,
  whereas optimp prints to zgoubi.OPTICS.out. Both are called from opticc.
