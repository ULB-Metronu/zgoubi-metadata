  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  CHAMBR causes the identification, counting and stopping of particles that reach the transverse limits of the vacuum
  chamber. The chamber can be either rectangular (IFORM = 1) or elliptic (IFORM = 2). The chamber is centered at YC,
  ZC and has transverse dimensions ±Y L and ±ZL such that any particle will be stopped if its coordinates Y, Z
  satisfy.

  The conditions introduced with CHAMBR are valid along the optical structure until the next occurrence of the
  keyword CHAMBR. Then, if IL = 1 the aperture is possibly modified by introducing new values of YC, ZC, Y L and ZL,
  or, if IL = 2 the chamber ends and information is printed concerning those particles that have been stopped.

  The testing is done in optical elements at each integration step, between the EFB’s. For instance, in QUADRUPO
  there will be no testing from −XE to 0 and from XL to XL + XS, but only from 0 to XL ; in DIPOLE, there is no
  testing as long as the ENTRANCE EFB is not reached, and testing is stopped as soon as the EXIT or LATERAL EFB’s
  are passed.

  In optical elements defined in polar coordinates, Y stands for the radial coordinate (e.g., DIPOLE, see Figs. 3C,
  p. 27, and 11, p. 82). Thus, centering CHAMBR at Y C = RM simulates a chamber curved with radius RM, and having a
  radial acceptance RM ± YL. In DRIFT, the testing is done at the beginning and at the end, and only for positive
  drifts. There is no testing in CHANGREF.

  When a particle is stopped, its index IEX (see OBJET and section 4.6.10) is set to the value -4, and its actual
  path length is stored in the array SORT for possible further use.
