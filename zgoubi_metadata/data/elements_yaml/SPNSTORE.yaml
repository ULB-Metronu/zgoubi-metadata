  Store spin coordinates in file FNAME

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``SPNSTORE`` has an effect similar to ``SPNPRNL``, with two more features.

  * On the first data line, ``FNAME`` may be followed by a series of up to 10 LABELs proper to the elements of the zgoubi.dat
    data file at the exit of which the print should occur ; if no label is given, the print occurs by default at the very location of
    ``SPNSTORE`` ; if labels are given, then print occurs right downstream of all optical elements wearing those labels
    (and no longer at the ``SPNSTORE`` location).

  * The next data line gives a parameter, ``IP`` : printing will
    occur every ``IP`` other pass, when using ``REBELOTE`` with
    ``NPASS ≥ IP − 1``.

  For instance the following data input in zgoubi.dat :
  ``SPNSTORE``
  zgoubi.spn HPCKUP VPCKUP
  12
  will result in output prints into zgoubi.spn, every 12 other pass,
  each time elements of the zgoubi.dat data list labeled either
  ``HPCKUP`` or ``VPCKUP`` are encountered.
