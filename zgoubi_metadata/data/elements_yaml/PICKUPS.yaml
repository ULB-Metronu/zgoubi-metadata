  Bunch centroid path; orbit

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``PICKUPS`` computes the average values of the coordinates of the particles in a bunch (coordinates of the bunch centroid) at one
  or more keywords specified by their ``LABELs`` . The list of ``LABEL(s)`` concerned is specified by the user, as part of the arguments
  under the keyword ``PICKUPS``.
  In conjunction with ``REBELOTE`` in the case of a periodic structure, with ``REBELOTE`` thus being used to cause multi-turn
  tracking, ``PICKUPS`` are zeroed at start of each turn.
  Pickup data computed during zgoubi execution are stored in the file zgoubi.PICKUP.out, usable for further analysis, or for
  plotting (for instance, using gnuplot).
  A summary of the list of pickups and their individual bunch data is listed in the result file zgoubi.res (below the ``END`` keyword)
  at the end of zgoubi execution. It is concluded with statistics as the rms, minimum and maximum values of the bunch centroid
  data over the ensemble of pickups.
