  Matrix transfer

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``TRANSMAT`` performs a second order transport of the particle coordinates in the following way

  .. math::

    X_i = \sum_j R_{ij} X_{j}^{0} + \sum_{j,k} T_{ijk} X_{j}^{0}X_{k}^{0}

  where, :math:`X_i` stands for any of the current coordinates Y , T, Z, P, path length and momentum dispersion,
  and :math:`X_i^0` stands for any of the initial coordinates. [Rij ] ([Tijk]) is the first order (second order) transfer matrix
  as usually involved in second order beam optics [35]. Second order transfer is optional. The length of the
  element represented by the matrix may be introduced for the purpose of path length updating.

  Note : ``MATRIX`` delivers [Rij ] and [Tijk] matrices in a format suitable for straightforward use with ``TRANSMAT``
