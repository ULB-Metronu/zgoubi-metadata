  Taylor expansions order

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  The position :math:`\vec{R}` and velocity :math:`\vec{u}` of a particle are obtained from Taylor expansions as described in eq. (1.2.4).
  By default, these expansions are up to the fifth order derivative of :math:`\vec{u}`,

  .. math::

    \begin{align}
      \vec{R_1} & \approx \vec{R_0} + \vec{u}\Delta s + ... \vec{u}^{(5)}\frac{\Delta s^6}{6!} \\
      \vec{u_1} & \approx \vec{u} + \vec{u}'\Delta s + ... \vec{u}^{(5)}\frac{\Delta s^}{5!} \\ \\
    \end{align}

  which corresponds to fourth order derivatives of fields :math:`\vec{B}`, eq. (1.2.8). and of :math:`\vec{E}` , eq. (1.2.13).
  However, third or higher order derivatives of fields may be zero in some optical elements, for instance in a
  sharp edge quadrupole. Also, in several elements, no more than first and second order field derivatives are
  implemented in the code. One may also wish to save on computation time by limiting the time-consuming
  calculation of lengthy (while possibly ineffective in terms of accuracy) Taylor expansions.
  In that spirit, the purpose of ``ORDRE``, option ``IO`` = 2 âˆ’ 5, is to allow for expansions to the :math:`\vec{u}^`{(n)} term in
  eq. 1.2.4. Default functioning is IO = 4, stated in ``FORTRAN`` file block.f.

  Note the following :
    As concerns the optical elements ``DECAPOLE``, ``DODECAPO``, ``EBMULT``, ``ELMULT``, ``MULTIPOL``, ``OCTUPOLE``,
    ``QUADRUPO``, ``SEXTUPOL``
    field derivatives (see eq. 1.2.10 p. 21, eq. 1.2.15 p. 22,) have been installed in the code according to :math:`\vec{u}^`{(5)}
    Taylor development order ; it may not be as complete for other optical elements. In particular, in electric
    optical elements field derivatives (eq. 1.2.15) are usually provided to no more than second order, which
    justifies saving on computing time by means of ``ORDRE``, so to avoid pushing Taylor expansions as high as :math:`\vec{u}^`{(n)}.

  ** NOTE ** : see also the option ``IORDRE`` in field map declarations (``DIPOLE-M``, ``TOSCA``, etc.).
