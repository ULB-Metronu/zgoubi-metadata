  Calculation of transfer coefficients, periodic parameters

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``MATRIX`` causes the calculation of the transfer coefficients through the optical structure, from the ``OBJET`` down to the location
  where ``MATRIX`` is introduced in the structure, or, upon option, down to the horizontal focus closest to that location. In this last
  case the position of the focus is calculated automatically in the same way as the position of the waist in ``IMAGE``. Depending
  on ``OBJET`` and on option ``IFOC``, ``MATRIX`` also delivers the beam matrix and betatron phase advances or (case of a periodic
  structure) periodic beam matrix and tunes, chromaticities and other global parameters.
  Depending on the value of option ``IORD``, different procedures follow

  * If ``IORD`` = 0, ``MATRIX`` is inhibited (equivalent to ``FAISCEAU``, whatever ``IFOC``).

  * If ``IORD`` = 1, using ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 5[.N], the first order transfer matrix [Rij] is calculated, from a third order approximation
    of the coordinates. For instance

    .. math::

      \begin{align}
        Y^+ &= (\frac{Y}{T_0}) T_0 + (\frac{Y}{T_0^2}) T_0^2 +  (\frac{Y}{T_0^3}) T_0^3 \\
        Y^- &= -(\frac{Y}{T_0}) T_0 + (\frac{Y}{T_0^2}) T_0^2 -  (\frac{Y}{T_0^3}) T_0^3 \\
      \end{align}

    will yield, neglecting third order terms,

    .. math::

      R_{11} = (\frac{Y}{T_0}) = \frac{Y^+ - Y^-}{2T_0}

    This is repeated N times if ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 5.N (2 ≤ N ≤ 99) is used, so delivering first order data for each 11-particle
    set, with for each set the reference trajectory being trajectory number 1+(N-1)x11 in the Nx11-particle list (keyword
    ``FAISCEAU`` will print out that list in zgoubi.res, if desired).
    If ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 5.1 is used instead (hence introducing initial optical function values, :math:`\alpha_{Y, Z}`,
    :math:`\alpha_{Y, Z}`, :math:`\D_{Y, Z}`, :math:`\D'_{Y, Z}`), then, using the Rij above,
     ``MATRIX`` will transport the optical functions and phase advances :math:`\phi_{Y}` , :math:`\phi_{Z}`, following

     .. math::

       \begin{pmatrix}
       \beta \\
       \alpha \\
       \gamma
       \end{pmatrix}_{at\,MATRIX}
       =
       \begin{pmatrix}
       R_{11}^2 & -2R_{11}R_{12} & R_{12}^2 \\
       -R_{11}R_{21} & R_{12}R_{21} & R_{11}R_{12}  \\
       R_{21}^2 & -2R_{21}R_{22} & R_{22}^2
       \end{pmatrix}_{at\,MATRIX}
       \begin{pmatrix}
       \beta \\
       \alpha \\
       \gamma
       \end{pmatrix}_{at\,OBJET}

    .. math::

      \begin{align}
      \Delta \phi_Y &= Atan \frac{R_{12}}{(R_{11} \beta_{Y, objet} - R_{12} \alpha_{Y, objet})} \\
      \Delta \phi_Z &= Atan \frac{R_{34}}{(R_{33} \beta_{Z, objet} - R_{34} \alpha_{Z, objet})} \\
      \end{align}

    .. math::

      \phi_{Y, Z} \rightarrow \phi_{Y, Z} + 2\pi \text{ if } \phi_{Y, Z} < 0, \text{ given [0, $\pi$] Atan determination}

    and print these out.

  * If ``IORD`` = 2, using ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 6, fifth order Taylor expansions are used for the calculation of the first order transfer
    matrix [Rij ] and of the second order matrix [Tijk]. Other higher order coefficients are also calculated.

  * If ``IORD`` = 3, using ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 6.1, transport coefficients up to 3rd order are computed using 102 rays (after routines
    developed for ``RAYTRACE`` [65, 66]).

  An automatic generation of an appropriate object for the use ofMATRIX can be obtained using the procedureOBJET (pages 59, 282),
  as follows

  * if ``IORD`` = 1, use ``OBJET``(``KOBJ`` = 5[.N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 99]), that generates up to 99*11 initial coordinates. In this case, up to 99
    matrices may be calculated, each one wrt. to the reference trajectory of concern (trajectory number 1, 12, 23, ... 1+(N-1)x11
    respectively).

  * if ``IORD`` = 2, use ``OBJET``(``KOBJ`` = 6) that generates 61 initial coordinates.

  * if ``IORD`` = 3, use ``OBJET``(``KOBJ`` = 6.1) that generates 102 initial coordinates

  The next option, IFOC, acts as follows

  * If ``IFOC`` = 0, the transfer coefficients are calculated at the location ofMATRIX, and with respect to the reference trajectory.
    For instance, :math:`Y^+` and :math:`T^+` above are defined for particle number i as :math:`Y^+` = :math:`Y^+(i) - Y(Ref)`,
    and :math:`T^+` = :math:`T^+(i) - T(Ref)`.

  * If ``IFOC`` = 1, the transfer coefficients are calculated at the horizontal focus closest to ``MATRIX`` (determined automatically),
    while the reference direction is that of the reference particle. For instance, :math:`Y^+` is defined for particle number i as
    :math:`Y^+ = Y^+(i) − Y_{focus}`, while :math:`T^+` is defined as :math:`T^+` = :math:`T^+(i) - T(Ref)`).

    * If ``IFOC`` = 2, no change of reference frame is performed : the coordinates refer to the current frame. Namely, :math:`Y^+ = Y^+(i)`,
      :math:`T^+ = T^+(i)`, etc.

  ** Periodic Structures **

  * If ``IFOC`` = 10 +NPeriod, then, from the 1-turn transport matrix as obtained in the way described above, ``MATRIX`` calculates
  periodic parameters characteristic of the structure such as optical functions and tune numbers, assuming that it is NPeriod -
  periodic. In non-coupled hypothesis, this is performed by a simple identification

  .. math::

    [T_{ij}] = I cos \mu + J sin \mu

  In the coupled hypothesis, the computation uses the Edwards-Teng method [37].
  Matrix computation is repeated N times if ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 5.N (2 ≤ N ≤ 99) is used, so delivering first order data for
  each of the N 11-particle sets.

  If ``IORD`` = 2 (using ``OBJET``, ``KOBJ`` = 6) additional periodic parameters are computed such as chromaticities, beta-function
  momentum dependence, etc.

  ``PRINT`` : Addition of ``PRINT`` following ``IORD``, ``IFOC`` [, coupled] will cause stacking of ``MATRIX`` output data into
  zgoubi.MATRIX.out file (convenient for use with e.g. gnuplot type of data treatment software).
  Addition of “coupled ” next to ``IORD``, ``IFOC`` [, ``PRINT``], in the case of periodic beam matrix
  request (i.e., ``IFOC`` = 10 + NPeriod ) will cause use of coupled formalism.

  :underline:`About the source code`:

  The program matric computes the transport matrix coefficients, it is called by zgoubi when the keyword ``MATRIX`` is met
  along the zgoubi.dat sequence. matimp, called by matric, ensures the print out of the matrix (and possibly the beam matrix)
  in zgoubi.res, and upon ``PRINT`` option in zgoubi.MATRIX.out as well.
