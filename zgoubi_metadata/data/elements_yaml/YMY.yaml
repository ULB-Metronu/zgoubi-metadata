  Reverse signs of Y and Z axes

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``YMY`` performs a 180 degrees rotation of particle coordinates with respect to the X-axis, as shown in Fig. 42. This
  is done by means of a change of sign of Y and Z axes, and therefore coordinates, as follows

  .. math::

    \begin{align}
      Y2 &= -Y1 \\
      T2 &= -T1 \\
      Z2 &= -Z1 \\
      P2 = -P1
    \end{align}
