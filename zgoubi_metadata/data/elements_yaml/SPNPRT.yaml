  Print spin coordinates

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``SPNPRT`` can be introduced anywhere in a structure. It produces a print out (to zgoubi.res) of various informations
  such as the initial and actual coordinates and modulus of the spin of the ``IMAX`` particles, their Lorentz factor :math:`\gamma`,
  the mean values of the spin components, etc., at the location where it is placed in the zgoubi.dat data list.

  ``PRINT`` : If ``PRINT`` appears after ``SPNPRT``, then spin data will be stored in zgoubi.SPNPRT.Out. The latter is opened at the
  first occurence of ``PRINT``. In particular, if ``REBELOTE`` is used then data will be stacked in zgoubi.SPNPRT.Out.

  ``MATRIX`` : If ``MATRIX‚Äù appears after ``SPNPRT``, then spin rotation matrix (or matrices) will be computed. This is done assuming
  appropriate initial particle and spin sampling has been defined (by respectively ``OBJET`` and ``SPNTRK``), as follows :

  * three particles are needed for SPNPRT to compute a spin matrix. All three have identical initial coordinates (for instance,
    the local stable precession axis coordinates) and rigidity, and their spins are on a direct triedra, for instance, respectively,
    (SX, SY , SZ) = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1),

  * there may be several groups of three particles, each group with a particular rigidity (i.e., the three particles in a group
    have the same momentum). ``OBJET`` with ``KOBJ=1`` or ``KOBJ=2`` can be used for instance to generate these particles by groups of
    like rigidity. ``SPNPRT`` will thus compute as many matrices.
