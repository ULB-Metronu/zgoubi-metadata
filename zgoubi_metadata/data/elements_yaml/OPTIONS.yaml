  Global or special options

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``OPTIONS`` allows on/off switching of various options.
  Available, for now :

  * ``WRITE ON`` or ``OFF``

  Role : inhibit (most of) write statements to zgoubi.res.
  Interest : ``WRITE OFF`` may allow substantial savings on CPU time. ``WRITE ON`` sets back to
  normal (the ’normal’ state of write outs may depend on the status of other commands, such as ``REBELOTE``,
  on-going FIT[2], etc.).

  * ``CONSTY ON`` or ``OFF``

  Role : force to constant Y and Z coordinates during stepwise integration.
  This allows for instance checking fields, or fabricating field maps from zgoubi’s analytical models of
  optical elements, as follows.

  Concurrent use of with IL = 1, 2, or 7 (cf. Sec. 7.6, p. 200) will allow logging ~B and/or ~E field(s)
  (and their derivatives) experienced across optical elements, in zgoubi.res, zgoubi.plt or zgoubi.impdev.out
  respectively.
  As a consequence, forcing Y and Z to constant values, using ``CONSTY ON``, allows checking of fields
  (and derivatives) at constantY and Z, as determined byOBJET, across (individual or short series of) optical
  elements. This may be helpful when setting up input data in zgoubi. It can be for instance of great help in
  case of complex geometrical and field data inputs, as in ``DIPOLES``, ``FFAG``.
  Initial coordinates are set in a very regular manner using ``OBJET``. The ``Y`` coordinate will stand for the radius
  value in the case of optical elements defined in polar coordinates (e.g., ``DIPOLES``, polar field maps, etc.).
