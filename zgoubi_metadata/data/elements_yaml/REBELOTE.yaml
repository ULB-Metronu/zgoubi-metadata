  ’Do it again’

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  When ``REBELOTE`` is encountered in the input data file, the code execution jumps,

  * either back to the beginning of the data file - the default behavior,

  * or, if option K=99.1 or K=99.2, back to a particular ``LABEL``.

  Then ``NPASS-1`` passes (from ``LABEL`` to ``REBELOTE``) follow.
  As to the last pass, number ``NPASS+1``, there are two possibilities :

  * either it also encompasses the whole ``LABEL`` to ``REBELOTE`` range,

  * or, upon request (option ``K=99.2`` ), execution may exit that final pass upstream of ``REBELOTE``, at
  a location defined by a second dedicated ``LABEL`` placed between the first above mentioned ``LABEL``,
  and ``REBELOTE``. In both cases, following the end of this “multiple-pass” procedure, the execution continues
  from the keyword which follows ``REBELOTE``, until ``END`` is encountered.
  The two functionalities of ``REBELOTE`` are the following :

  * ``REBELOTE`` can be used for Monte Carlo simulations when more than Max(``IMAX``) particles are to be
  tracked. Thus, when the following random procedures are used : ``MCOBJET``, ``OBJETA``, ``MCDESINT``,
  ``SPNTRK`` (``KSO`` = 5), their random seeds are not reset and independent statistics will add up.

  This includes Monte Carlo simulations, in beam lines : normally ``K`` = 0. ``NPASS`` runs through the same
  structure, from ``MCOBJET`` to ``REBELOTE`` will follow, resulting in the calculation of (1+``NPASS`` )*IMAX
  trajectories, with as many random initial coordinates.

  * ``REBELOTE`` can be used for multi-turn ray-tracing in circular machines : normally ``K`` = 99 in that case
  (or ``K`` = 99, see below). ``NPASS`` turns in the same structure will follow, resulting in the tracking of ``IMAX``
  particles over 1+``NPASS`` turns. For the simulation of pulsed power supplies, synchrotron motion, and other Q-jump
  manipulation, see ``SCALING``.

  For instance, using option described ``K=99.2`` above, a full “injection line + ring + extraction line” installation
  can be simulated - kicker firing and other magnet ramping can be simulated using ``SCALING``.
  Using the double-``LABEL`` method discussed above with option ``K=99.2``, it is possible to encompass the ring
  between an injection line section (namely, with the element sequence of the latter extending from ``OBJET``
  to the first ``LABEL``), and an extraction line (its description will then follow ``REBELOTE``), whereas the ring
  description extends from to the first ``LABEL`` to ``REBELOTE``, with possible extraction, at the last pass, at the
  location of the second ``LABEL``, located between the first one and ``REBELOTE``,

  Note : Some ``CAVITE`` options cause a reset-to-zero of individual particle path length 11. This is for reasons
  of cumulated path length accuracy (a delta-path below computer accuracy compared to total path length
  would not be resolved - it can be for instance bunch length as compared to cumulated multi-turn distance
  around a large ring). This reset may not be desirable, it depends on the multi-turn problem dealt with using
  ``REBELOTE``, it may be necessary for instance in long-term tracking in large rings, it is not in recirculating
  linacs. Option K=99 in ``REBELOTE`` will cause this reset, whereas option K=98 (UNDER DEVELOPMENT,
  In cavite.f, IN THIS VERSION OF THE CODE) will avoid it everything else left unchanged.

  * Case ``IOPT``=1 : In addition to what precedes, ``REBELOTE`` can change the value of arbitrary parameters in
  zgoubi.dat data list, using the forth argument ``IOPT=1`` (see page 299). ``NPRM`` tells the number of parameters
  to be changed. A series of ``NPRM`` lists of values, one list per parameter to be changed and each list with ``NRBLT``
  data, tells the values to be taken by each one of these parameters, over the ``NRBLT`` passes of the
  ``REBELOTE`` process. ``IOPT=1`` is under development. TO BE DOCUMENT FURTHER.

  * Printouts over ``NPASS+1`` passes might result in a prohibitively big zgoubi.res file. They may be switched
  on/off by means of the option ``KWRIT= i.j``, with i = 1/0 respectively. The j flag allows a printout of the
  pass number and of some additional information to the video output, every 10j−1 turns if j > 0 ; video
  output is essentially switched off during ``REBELOTE`` execution if j = 0.

  ``REBELOTE`` also provides information : statistical calculations and related data regarding particle decay
  (``MCDESINT``), spin tracking (``SPNTRK``), stopped particles (``CHAMBR``, ``COLLIMA``), etc.
