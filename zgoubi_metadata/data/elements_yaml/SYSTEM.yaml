  System call

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  The keyword ``SYSTEM`` allows one or a series of system calls. It can appear anywhere, an arbitrary number of times, in the
  zgoubi.dat data list. It is effective at the very location where it appears.
  ``SYSTEM`` keyword is followed by the list of the desired system commands. That can be saving zgoubi output files, calling again
  zgoubi at the end of a run so allowing dependent consecutive jobs, etc.
  EXAMPLES - Examples of the use of ``SYSTEM`` are given in pp. 262, 316.
